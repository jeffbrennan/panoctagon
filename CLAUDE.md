# Purpose
panoctagon is a project designed to aggregate, analyze, and visualize the outcomes of UFC fights.

# Code style
- Never add comments that simply describe what the code beneath is doing
- Only add comments when an implementation is non-obvious, and cannot be done simpler
- Always prioritize writing simple, readable code unless specifically asked otherwise
- Do not over-abstract implementations unless specifically asked otherwise
